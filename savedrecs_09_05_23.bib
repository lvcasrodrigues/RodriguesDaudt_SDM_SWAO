Title = {Projecting future climate change impacts on the distribution of the
   `Octopus vulgaris species complex'},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {IntroductionHistorically considered to be a single cosmopolitan species,
   the so called Octopus vulgaris species complex (OVSC) is now recognized
   to be a group of (at least) six cryptic species: O. americanus (in the
   west Atlantic), O. vulgaris (in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean
   Sea), O. aff. vulgaris (in the region of South Africa), O. tetricus
   (southeastern Oceania), O. sinensis (northwestern Pacific), and O.
   djinda (western Australia). The potentially different environmental
   preferences of this highly cryptic species complex may result in
   distinct consequences under future environmental conditions. MethodsThe
   present study employed species distribution models (SDM) using MaxEnt to
   investigate potential changes in habitat suitability and geographical
   distribution of the OVSC in the future (i.e., 2050, and 2100), across
   four representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP-2.6, 4.5, 6.0,
   and 8.5, CMIP5). ResultsDifferential responses were observed in the OVSC
   species analyzed. Specifically, O. vulgaris and O. tetricus exhibited a
   severe loss in distribution across their predicted range; O. americanus
   exhibited projected extirpation close to the equator, with limited
   expansion towards the poles; O. aff. vulgaris was projected to lose half
   of its current distribution; O. sinensis exhibited moderate losses, with
   projected increases in northern areas; and finally, O. djinda exhibited
   limited losses to its distribution. Except for O. sinensis, increasing
   RCP severity exacerbated changes in mean habitat suitability and
   projected distribution gains and losses. DiscussionUltimately, this
   study provides information on the potential biogeographical effects of
   marine climate change on a key worldwide ecological and economic
   resource to further disentangle the effects over each OVSC species, with
   the goal of assisting toward the sustainable management of octopus
   species at the global scale.},

Title = {Seascape genetics in a polychaete worm: Disentangling the roles of a
   biogeographic barrier and environmental factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2296-2308},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aim Seascape genomic studies aim to understand how environmental
   variables shape species diversity through genotype-environment
   associations. Identifying these effects on lecithotrophic larval species
   that live in intertidal zones is particularly challenging because they
   are subject to environmental heterogeneity and anthropogenic events.
   Here, we evaluate how biotic and abiotic features in the Southwest
   Atlantic littoral zone can affect a high dispersal species' present and
   historical demography. Location Brazilian coast, covering more than 3000
   km. Taxon Perinereis ponteni. Methods We investigated population genetic
   diversity, connectivity and past dynamics using 23,300 single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) generated using genotyping by sequencing. We tested
   whether environmental abiotic variables could explain the variance found
   in genotype frequencies using isolation-by-environment (IBE) and
   landscape association approaches. These data, combined with
   palaeodistribution simulations and oceanic circulation modelling, were
   used to infer species demographic history and connectivity patterns.
   Results Along with high levels of connectivity detected, we found a
   genetic boundary in the southeastern region of Brazil around Cabo Frio
   (Rio de Janeiro), and a cline trend for some loci. The
   palaeodistribution simulations reveal a spatial refuge in the southeast
   during the Last Glacial Maximum (21 kya), with the expansion of the
   northern region. We identified 1421 SNPs with frequencies associated
   with eight environmental variables, most of which were related to
   temperature-the main environmental factor determining IBE. Main
   Conclusions Perinereis ponteni, a polychaete with high gene flow
   capability responds to biogeographic barriers, highlighting the
   importance of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping population
   connectivity. Furthermore, the effect of temperature indicates that
   future climate change and ocean warming can hugely impact this species.},

Abstract = {Population-scale information on the spatial ecology of threatened mobile
   sharks is required to design more effective management measures. Using
   an exhaustive collection of presence-only records and relevant
   predictors, we applied temporally explicit environmental niche modelling
   to study habitat use by a school shark Galeorhinus galeus population in
   the Southwest Atlantic. As a complementary tool, we developed randomized
   habitat association curves to assess both the representation of data
   with biological information and possible intra-population variation in
   habitat use. Seasonal niche models supported a core area of distribution
   between southern Brazil and southern Argentina. Marginal seasonal
   variation in suitability at the northern and southern extremes of its
   distribution supported the hypothesis that the G. galeus population
   behaves to some degree as a niche shifter on an annual cycle. Habitat
   associations revealed regional bias in the collection of records with
   biological information, and suggested a complex intra-population
   segregation pattern between sexes and between maturity stages during the
   cold half of the year. Overall, results supported large-scale partial
   migrations (i.e. some individuals migrate while others remain resident)
   of the G. galeus population. This study demonstrates the significance of
   future regional efforts that focus on producing more and better
   databases to derive relevant information at a low cost for the
   management of threatened sharks and their relatives.},

Title = {Identifying suitable areas for common bottlenose dolphin in anthropized

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {169},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Understanding the processes that determine the occurrence of species,
   especially for those exposed to human activities, is key to appropriate
   management. The common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, is well
   studied worldwide, but very little attention has been given to transient
   groups of this species and how such groups are exposed to human
   activities. Here, we modeled and mapped how the environment and human
   activities drives bottlenose dolphin habitat suitability, and residence
   patterns in an anthropized area of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. To
   predict habitat suitability, we ran 300 distribution models, including
   six algorithms, and generated an ensemble model. In parallel, we used
   photo-identification techniques to investigate dolphins' residence
   patterns. Our results demonstrated that primary productivity, seabed
   slope and port activities explained dolphins' habitat suitability. The
   most suitable areas included coastal waters, nearby port complexes and
   shipping routes. We also identified a low degree of residence in Cabo
   Frio and Rio de Janeiro city waters, but calves were constantly sighted
   there, indicating an important area for caring and nursing. The high
   overlap between the dolphins' most suitable areas and human activities,
   such as ports, vessel traffic and fisheries spots, plus the presence of
   calves in these areas, highlights the need for safeguard measurements to
   protect these animals from anthropogenic threats. Our results can be
   used to support management decisions, such as fisheries regulations and
   the creation of new marine protected areas to conserve critical habitats
   for this species.},

Abstract = {Predicting the potential distribution of species and possible dispersal
   corridors at a global scale can contribute to better understanding the
   availability of suitable habitat to move between, and the potential
   connectivity between regional distributions. Such information increases
   knowledge of ecological and biogeographic processes, but also has
   management applications at a global scale, for example, for estimating
   the restocking ability of exploited regional subpopulations. As a case
   study, we tested the utility of environmental niche modeling to
   investigate the potential global distribution of a highly mobile
   temperate marine coastal species, the broadnose sevengill shark
   (Notorynchus cepedianus). First, we characterized and compared three
   model variants using global data and regional data from two
   geographically distant and genetically diverging subpopulations in the
   Southwest Atlantic and southern Australia. The best performing model was
   then transferred to the rest of the world to obtain a final global
   prediction for the species. Predictions revealed broad suitable areas
   across temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. As a
   final step, we overlaid underwater seamount data on suitability maps to
   simulate possible dispersal corridors and regional connectivity. Global
   subpopulation connectivity and dispersal are discussed in the light of
   recent genetic evidence, to help explain why unoccupied suitable areas
   are not currently accessed by the species. This study highlights the
   potential use of global and regional data for the assessment of habitat
   suitability of species at a global scale, and provides considerations
   when applying these models to other highly mobile species.},

   Squid Species in the Antarctic Adjacent Waters},

Abstract = {Variation in Antarctic sea ice strongly impacts marine ecosystem and
   fisheries. In this study, Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE) was used as an
   indicator to characterize the Antarctic sea ice variation, and its
   impact on habitat pattern of Argentine shortfin squid Illex argentinus,
   a climate-sensitive squid species extensively distributed in the
   Antarctic adjacent waters, was assessed using the habitat suitability
   index (HSI) modeling approach. The HSI model was established on the
   basis of the fisheries data and sea water temperature at critical depths
   of 50, 100, and 200 m in the high-sea fishing ground of the Southwest
   Atlantic Ocean from January to April during 1979-2017. Results showed
   that a significantly positive correlation was found between SIE and the
   areas of suitable habitat of I. argentinus. The years with high and low
   SIE were selected and divided into two groups from 1979 to 2017.
   Generally, the year group with high SIE yielded warmer sea water
   temperature at different depths; consequently, the suitable habitats
   enlarged; and the optimal temperature isotherm for I. argentinus moved
   northward, resulting in a northward movement of suitable habitats. On
   the contrary, the situation in the year group with low SIE was opposite.
   Our findings suggest that the melting Antarctic sea ice is yielding
   adverse effects on I. argentinus habitat in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean
   by affecting the sea water temperature at three critical depths.},

Title = {Individual and joint estimation of humpback whale migratory patterns and
   their environmental drivers in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) perform seasonal migrations
   from high latitude feeding grounds to low latitude breeding and calving
   grounds. Feeding grounds at polar regions are currently experiencing
   major ecosystem modifications, therefore, quantitatively assessing
   species responses to habitat characteristics is crucial for
   understanding how whales might respond to such modifications. We
   analyzed satellite telemetry data from 22 individual humpback whales in
   the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWA). Tagging effort was divided in two
   periods, 2003-2012 and 2016-2019. Correlations between whale's movement
   parameters and environmental variables were used as proxy for inferring
   behavioral responses to environmental variation. Two versions of a
   covariate-driven continuous-time correlated random-walk state-space
   model, were fitted to the data: i) Population-level models (P-models),
   which assess correlation parameters pooling data across all individuals
   or groups, and ii) individual-level models (I-models), fitted
   independently for each tagged whale. Area of Restricted Search behavior
   (slower and less directionally persistent movement, ARS) was
   concentrated at cold waters south of the Polar Front (similar to 50
   degrees S). The best model showed that ARS was expected to occur in
   coastal areas and over ridges and seamounts. Ice coverage during August
   of each year was a consistent predictor of ARS across models. Wind
   stress curl and sea surface temperature anomalies were also correlated
   with movement parameters but elicited larger inter-individual variation.
   I-models were consistent with P-models' predictions for the case of
   females accompanied by calves (mothers), while males and those of
   undetermined sex (males +) presented more variability as a group.
   Spatial predictions of humpback whale behavioral responses showed that
   feeding grounds for this population are concentrated in the complex
   system of islands, ridges, and rises of the Scotia Sea and the northern
   Weddell Ridge. More southernly incursions were observed in recent years,
   suggesting a potential response to increased temperature and large ice
   coverage reduction observed in the late 2010s. Although, small sample
   size and differences in tracking duration precluded appropriately
   testing predictions for such a distributional shift, our modelling
   framework showed the efficiency of borrowing statistical strength during
   data pooling, while pinpointing where more complexity should be added in
   the future as additional data become available.},

Abstract = {Elysiais a genus of sea slugs in which some species can ``steal{''}
   chloroplasts (kleptoplasty) from algae and keep them photosynthetically
   active inside their cells. Solar-powered animals are more susceptible to
   climate change as photosynthesis can increase the stress for these
   animals in extreme environmental conditions. Here, we used the Maxent
   algorithm and environmental envelopes (i.e. the multi-dimensional
   environmental space in which a species can occur) to model the
   ecological niche of 21 Elysia species in the Caribbean to estimate their
   current and future potential distribution. We then used predicted
   distributions to map potential taxonomical richness and to describe the
   representation of the genus inside the marine protected areas (MPAs).
   For most species, we show an expansion of the northern and southern
   range of distribution, but a reduction in the central part. Although
   changes in richness appeared in different areas, predictions emphasize
   four large extensions that have a potential current richness of 13 and
   will have no species in the future: Pamlico Sound, North Carolina; the
   southwest of the Gulf of Mexico; the Great Bahama Bank; and the
   southwest of Brazil. Out of the total area with environmental conditions
   adequate for at least one of the species in the genus, 24.7\% is located
   within MPAs.},

Abstract = {Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are showing strong recovery
   from commercial whaling in the western South Atlantic. In this region,
   humpback whales migrate annually from their winter breeding grounds off
   the coast of Brazil to their summer feeding grounds near to the Polar
   Front, an area that includes the waters of South Georgia and the South
   Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). This latter region includes a Marine Protected
   Area (MPA), which has been developed to ensure sustainable management of
   fisheries, and protection of foraging predators. To date, management
   measures within the MPA have primarily been concerned with foraging
   predators that rely upon Antarctic krill, including for a number of
   previously over-exploited species. With humpback whales increasing in
   the western South Atlantic, understandingnderstanding their
   spatiotemporal distribution within the MPA is important as it will help
   inform management particularly in respect of interactions between
   humpback whales and the regional fishery for Antarctic krill. Here we
   develop habitat models from the distribution and movement patterns of 16
   individuals at their high-latitude feeding grounds, south of 50 degrees
   S. We show that whale habitat use varies throughout the foraging period.
   Upon reaching their feeding ground, whales use the area to the east of
   the South Sandwich Islands, moving westward into the centre of the
   Scotia Arc and towards South Georgia during the high summer, and then
   expanding back towards the east in the winter. Based on these findings,
   we discuss the implications for the future, including necessary research
   required for underpinning management.},

Title = {Population abundance of recovering humpback whales Megaptera
   novaeangliae and other baleen whales in the Scotia Arc, South Atlantic},

Abstract = {Following the cessation of whaling, South Atlantic populations of
   humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and some other baleen whale species are
   recovering, but there has been limited monitoring of their recovery in
   the Scotia Arc, a former whaling epicentre and a hotspot for Antarctic
   krill Euphausia superba. To inform the management of krill fisheries,
   up-to-date assessment of whale biomass and prey consumption is
   essential. Using a model-based approach, we provide the first estimates
   of whale abundance and krill consumption for South Georgia and the South
   Sandwich Islands and total abundance of humpback whales across their
   southwestern Atlantic feeding grounds, using data collected in 2019.
   Humpback whale abundance was estimated at 24 543 (coefficient of
   variation, CV = 0.26; 95 \% CI = 14 863-40 528), similar to that
   measured in Brazil on the main wintering ground for this population. The
   abundance of baleen whales in South Georgia and the South Sandwich
   Islands, including those not identified to species level, was estimated
   at 43 824 (CV = 0.15, 95 \% CI = 33 509-59 077). Based on the proportion
   of humpback whales identified during the surveys (83 \%), the majority
   of these are likely to be humpback whales. Annual krill consumption by
   baleen whales was estimated to be in the range 4.8 to 7.2 million tons,
   representing 7 to 10\% of the estimated krill biomass in the region.
   However, there is a need to better understand feeding rates in baleen
   whales, and further research into this field should be a priority to
   improve the accuracy and precision of prey consumption rate estimation.},

   Hidden in the Deep Atlantic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Aplacophorans are common inhabitants of the deep-sea, where many places
   remain unexplored regarding their biodiversity. Filling a gap in
   knowledge about these animals from the South Atlantic, Scutopus
   variabilis sp. nov. (Caudofoveata, Limifossoridae) is described;
   further, species distribution modelling (SDM) was performed to elucidate
   the distribution patterns of Atlantic species of Scutopus. The type
   materials of S. megaradulatus Salvini-Plawen (1972) and S. chilensis
   Salvini-Plawen (1972), were examined and a search was performed for
   specimens of Scutopus held in museum collections. Scutopus variabilis
   sp. nov. has a slender and highly variable body form and a very distinct
   suture line is present midventrally. Two dominant types of trunk
   sclerites were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): one
   elongated with lateral margins slightly concave in medial portion, and
   another longer, with narrower base; its radula bears up to eight rows of
   heavily sclerotized teeth bearing 12-16 small denticles. The species
   occurs in a wide bathymetric range (40-1300 m), being more abundant at
   the edge between the continental shelf and upper slope. Outside the
   areas from where these samples were obtained, suitable areas for S.
   variabilis sp. nov. were found in the Southern Caribbean Sea (from where
   S. megaradulatus is recorded) and in the Brazilian Northern coast; the
   Gulf of Mexico and the Brazilian Northeastern coasts were found as
   unsuitable. Species of Scutopus appear to exhibit different patterns of
   geographical distribution: the European S. ventrolineatus Salvini-Plawen
   (1968) and S. robustus Salvini-Plawen (1970) are known as widely
   distributed, while non-European representants, the American S.
   megaradulatus, S. chilensis and S. variabilis sp. nov., and the Japanese
   S. schanderi Saito and Salvini-Plawen (2014) and S. hamatamii Saito and
   Salvini-Plawen (2014) have more restricted distributions. However, clear
   and definite patterns of distribution of some of these species are
   probably blurred by sampling bias, for the European area is better
   studied. In the Atlantic, the SDM showed that species of Scutopus occur
   in a way that overlapping is minimized. Great sampling efforts combined
   with detailed descriptions based on SEM have revealed an interesting,
   abundant and up to now undescribed Brazilian deep-sea malacofauna.},

Title = {Early detection of marine invasive species following the deployment of
   an artificial reef: Integrating tools to assist the decision-making
   process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {297},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Early detection and rapid response plans are a set of principles to
   reduce the establishment, spread and impact of invasive species and it
   is a critical step in management in marine ecosystems. Two potentially
   invasive ascidians attached to the hull of a recently sunk fishing
   vessel were early detected in Patagonia. With the aim of assisting in
   the management decision-making process during the early steps of a rapid
   response, we conducted several analyses through different approaches.
   First, we identified the species through classic taxonomical and genetic
   analyses. Then, we evaluated the regional and international shipping
   connectivity to study potential donor regions and finally, we used
   species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the potential distribution
   of these species. The potentially invasive ascidians were identified as
   Styela clava and Styela plicata, and this is the first record for both
   species in the Nuevo gulf, Patagonia Argentina. Both species have a
   widespread distribution around the world with strong ecological and
   economic impacts documented. Shipping traffic analysis suggested that S.
   plicata could have arrived by secondary spread from regional ports,
   while the arrival of S. clava was likely to be associated with
   international shipping traffic. Furthermore, the SDM predicted that S.
   clava has suitable coastal areas along the entire Southwestern Atlantic
   shoreline, where it is currently absent. On the contrary, the SDM
   predicted that further southward spread of S. plicata is unlikely, being
   limited by the minimum annual temperature. We discussed the different
   approaches, tools, and expertise integrated in this work in the light of
   the decision-making process for the early detection of marine invasive
   species in the Southwestern Atlantic. Moreover, we call attention to the
   increased creation of artificial habitats through the intentional
   sinking of ships and the potential consequences of these actions in the
   conservation of marine ecosystems.},

   habitat suitability of a rhodolith-forming species in the Southwestern
   Atlantic},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {169},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Given the ecological and biogeochemical importance of rhodolith beds, it
   is necessary to investigate how future environmental conditions will
   affect these organisms. We investigated the impacts of increased
   nutrient concentrations, acidification, and marine heatwaves on the
   performance of the rhodolith-forming species Lithothamnion crispatum in
   a short-term experiment, including the recovery of individuals after
   stressor removal. Furthermore, we developed an ecological niche model to
   establish which environmental conditions determine its current
   distribution along the Brazilian coast and to project responses to
   future climate scenarios. Although L. crispatum suffered a reduction in
   photosynthetic performance when exposed to stressors, they returned to
   preexperiment values following the return of individuals to control
   conditions. The model showed that the most important variables in
   explaining the current distribution of L. crispatum on the Brazilian
   coast were maximum nitrate and temperature. In future ocean conditions,
   the model predicted a range expansion of habitat suitability for this
   species of approximately 58.5\% under RCP 8.5. Physiological responses
   to experimental future environmental conditions corroborated model
   predictions of the expansion of this species' habitat suitability in the
   future. This study, therefore, demonstrates the benefits of applying
   combined approaches to examine potential species responses to
   climate-change drivers from multiple angles.},

Abstract = {An integrative taxonomic approach was adopted to confirm that the shrimp
   Cinetorhynchus erythrostictus was introduced into the Western Atlantic
   Ocean and it is for sale in the marine aquarium trade in Brazil,
   misidentified as C. rigens, a representative of the Atlantic fauna. The
   MaxEnt modeling technique was used to infer ecological niche models for
   Cinetorhynchus erythrostictus, an invasive (non-indigenous) species in
   the Atlantic Ocean, and C. rigens (native to the Atlantic Ocean).
   Subsequently, the hypothesis of niche conservatism over an evolutionary
   time scale was tested. The projection for C. erythrostictus suggested
   large areas of climatic suitability in the Atlantic Ocean. The
   background of the invasive species showed a similar range of
   environmental conditions to that of the native congeneric shrimp. The
   environmental niches of the native and invasive species overlap 26\%,
   with significant equivalency and similarity between niches. Thus, these
   species can develop competitive interactions across environmental
   gradients. Importantly, we recommend that greater efforts should be made
   to identify the ornamental marine species that are currently traded, in
   order to minimize the risk of spread of invasive species and,
   consequently, of potential ecological damage to native biodiversity.},

Title = {Global warming assessment suggests the endemic Brazilian kelp beds to be
   an endangered ecosystem},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Kelps are canopy-forming brown seaweed sustaining critical ecosystem
   services in coastal habitats, including shelter, nursery grounds, and
   providing food resources to a myriad of associated species. This study
   modeled the fundamental niche of Laminaria abyssalis along the Brazilian
   continental margin, an endemic species of the South Atlantic, to
   anticipate potential distributional range shifts under two contrasting
   scenarios of future environmental changes (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The model
   for fundamental niche predictions considering the ``present scenario{''}
   has shown a wider potential area than the realized niche (i.e., the area
   where the species actually occurs) along the Brazilian coast. In both
   future scenarios, the models have shown niche erosion on the northern
   portion of the Brazilian coast and niche gains towards the south. In
   both scenarios, L. abyssalis populations tend to shift to deeper regions
   of the reef. The restricted range of occurrence (33,000 km2), intense
   anthropic activities along these beds (e.g., trawling fisheries, oil/gas
   mining, or removal for agricultural purposes) acting synergically with
   global warming, may drive this ecosystem to collapse faster than kelp
   species' ability to adapt. We propose to classify L. abyssalis as
   Endangered - (EN) under IUCN criteria, and highlight that long-term
   monitoring of kelp beds is an urgent need to develop effective
   conservation initiatives to protect such rare and invaluable ecosystem.},

   areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES},

Abstract = {The western Atlantic Ocean is one of the areas with the largest species
   richness of sea slugs in the genus Elysia (30 out of the 101 species
   described have been reported in this region). Nevertheless, the lack of
   knowledge on many of these species hinders efforts to estimate regional
   richness and identify the factors affecting their distribution. We used
   the maximum entropy algorithm Maxent to develop ecological niche models
   for 14 species of Elysia in the western Atlantic Ocean. These models
   were meant to show the potential distribution of the genus and identify
   locations with the highest richness. Input data used to build niche
   models were presence records (obtained from several sources) and
   bioclimatic and geophysical variables from the Bio-ORACLE and MARSPEC
   platforms. Species with less than seven records were considered for the
   calculation of richness, but not for modelling. Results show low habitat
   suitability for the species modelled here at the mouth of rivers and in
   hypoxic zones and low-temperature areas. The two variables that best
   explained species distribution patterns were the distance to shore and
   the maximum monthly temperature. From the total area with adequate
   environmental conditions for the genus, only 20.3\% is located within
   marine areas under some protection category.},

Title = {Definition of no-fishing zones and fishing effort limits to reduce

Abstract = {Franciscana Pontoporia blainvillei bycatch has been high for near six
   decades in western South Atlantic, with large regional variation. In
   2012, the Brazilian Government-regulated gillnet fisheries in south and
   southeast Brazil by reducing fishing effort and establishing no-fishing
   zones. However, there is evidence that the magnitude of franciscana
   bycatch remains high and unsustainable. The aims of this study were to
   identify hotspot areas of franciscana bycatch associated with two main
   gillnet fisheries and to propose no-fishing zones combined with limited
   total allowable fishing effort (i.e. total net length per season) in
   order to meet management objectives in southern Brazil. A hierarchical
   Bayesian model using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) was
   employed based on 1427 reported settings from 1999 to 2003 and 2006 to
   2009. Hotspot zones were detected and are proposed as no-fishing zone
   during the white croaker Micropogonias furnieri and striped weakfish
   Cynoscion guatucupa gillnet fishing seasons. Their extents represent 6\%
   (1466.8 km(2)) and 19\% (4493.7 km(2)) of the fishing ground (23 204.1
   km(2)) during croaker and weakfish fishing seasons respectively. The
   total allowable fishing effort estimated outside the no-fishing zones
   were estimated at 541 km (95\% credible interval (CrI) {[}339; 940])
   during croaker and 688 km (CrI {[}312; 2,166]) during weakfish fishing
   seasons, one order of magnitude lower than the current total fishing
   effort. The drastic reduction of total fishing effort estimated in this
   study is largely due to weak protection measures since the gillnet
   fisheries became the major conservation concern for franciscana by the
   end of 1970s in southern Brazil. Although the implementation of the
   proposed exclusion zones and limiting fishing effort will strongly
   impact the status quo, they were based on the best scientific evidence
   and on a clearly defined management goal to reduce the risk of the
   franciscana population's collapse in southern Brazil.},

Abstract = {The diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia
   is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the breeding
   season, foraging trips by lactating female fur seals are constrained by
   their need to return to land to provision their pups. Post-breeding,
   seals disperse in order to feed and recover condition; estimates
   indicate c.70\% of females remain near to South Georgia, whilst others
   head west towards the Patagonian Shelf or south to the ice-edge. The
   krill fishery at South Georgia operates only during the winter,
   providing the potential for fur seal: fishery interaction during these
   months. Here we use available winter (May to September) tracking data
   from Platform Terminal Transmitter (PTT) tags deployed on female fur
   seals at Bird Island, South Georgia. We develop habitat models
   describing their distribution during the winters of 1999 and 2003 with
   the aim of visualising and quantifying the degree of spatial overlap
   between female fur seals and krill harvesting in South Georgia waters.
   We show that spatial distribution of fur seals around South Georgia is
   extensive, and that the krill fishery overlaps with small, highly
   localised areas of available fur seal habitat. From these findings we
   discuss the implications for management, and future work.},

Title = {Potential distribution of Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis): a
   coastal-estuarine and tropical habitat specialist},

Abstract = {Ecological niche models (ENMs) predict where species can occur in
   accordance with environmental factors. Suitability maps are generated
   through models to identify habitats more or less adapted to the species.
   Published works on the distribution and habitat use of Guiana dolphin,
   Sotalia guianensis, are limited to fine spatial scales. Here, we aimed
   to predict the potential geographical distribution of Guiana dolphins
   through ENMs and generate a map of suitable habitats for the species.
   Data were collected between 1997 and 2015 in Brazil, French Guiana, and
   Colombia. The environmental data were obtained from MARSPEC database
   with a cell resolution of 10 x 10 km. For modeling, 99 of the 859
   initial occurrence points of the species were considered after
   rarefaction. Seven environmental variables were selected through
   factorial analysis: bathymetry, distance to shore, bathymetric slope,
   sea surface salinity (minimum monthly and annual range), and sea surface
   temperature (mean annual and annual range). Results from five distinct
   algorithms were assembled to generate the distribution model. Our
   findings show potential areas in shallow platforms of the continental
   margin of South and Central America, including regions where the species
   has never been reported, such as the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of
   California, the Gulf of Mexico, and the oceanic islands in the Caribbean
   Sea. The absence of Guiana dolphins in these regions may be due to
   geographical (linking of North and South America), physical (water
   temperature), and biological (competition, limited ability to dispersal)
   limiting factors. The models suggest that the presence of other species
   of coastal dolphin may be an important limiting factor for the Guiana
   dolphin at both extremes of its distribution. The Guiana dolphin is
   habitat specialist with a clinal potential geographic distribution
   concentrated in tropical and subtropical shallow and coastal waters of
   the continental shelf of the western Atlantic Ocean. This more
   restricted distribution than reported by IUCN and other studies suggests
   a cautionary approach to its conservation status due to limited
   dispersal abilities and high overlap with human activities.},

Title = {Distribution patterns and habitat suitability of the non-native brittle
   star Ophiothela mirabilis Verrill, 1867 along the Western Atlantic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Pacific epizoic brittle star Ophiothela mirabilis Verrill, 1867 has
   successfully established itself along the Southwestern Atlantic. While
   reports of this species show high densities and an expanding range
   throughout the Western Atlantic, specific knowledge regarding
   populations and their potential for distribution is scarce. We assess
   herein the current distribution and abundance patterns of O. mirabilis
   along the subtropical SW Atlantic coast while simultaneously employing
   ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict suitable habitats in the
   future. Ophiothela mirabilis is currently distributed in both poly- and
   euhaline estuarine and inner continental shelf areas. Population
   densities tend to increase from the inner shelf (<= 492
   individuals.m(-2)) to estuarine habitats (>= 815 individuals.m(-2)),
   characterized by a 53.38\% mean habitat suitability index, until being
   limited by unsuitable environmental habitats. Octocoral species are the
   most densely and frequently colonized hosts (up to 3.6
   individuals.cm(-2) of host's area). Currently, occurrence records for O.
   mirabilis encompass disjunct habitats from Santa Catarina (S Brazil) to
   Southeast Florida (USA). Our ENMs predicted that O. mirabilis has the
   potential to further spread across the warm marine provinces of the
   Western Atlantic, as they are characterized by >= 40.72\% of
   environmentally suitable habitats. The occurrence of the species
   correlates mainly to mean calcite concentration and mean sea surface
   temperature, which accounts for 56.97\% of the performance of the ENMs.
   The high spreading capacity and the maintenance of dense abundances on
   hosts raises questions about its effects on recipient biodiversity and
   systems.},

Title = {Phylogenetic conservatism of abiotic niche in sympatric Southwestern
   Atlantic skates},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {458-473},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {From the perspective of phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC), closely
   related species must share more aspects of a niche than randomly
   expected. However, considering the competitive exclusion principle, PNC
   is questionable for related species in sympatry. This research aimed to
   test PNC in Riorajini, a tribe of four skates endemic to the
   Southwestern Atlantic Ocean: Atlantoraja castelnaui, A. cyclophora, A.
   platana, and Rioraja agassizii. We updated available distribution maps
   for these species with literature data, reconstructed the phylogenetic
   relationships of the group with genetic data (mt-nd2), modelled the
   ecological niche (ENM) of each species, and calculated niche overlap,
   equivalency and similarity between models. The results recovered
   Riorajini as a monophyletic group and indicated PNC with bathymetry,
   distance to shore and concentration of nitrate characterizing the
   tribe's abiotic niche. However, no linear relationship between
   phylogenetic proximity and niche similarity was clear since pairs of
   species more phylogenetically distant showed more similar niches (R.
   agassizii and A. castelnaui, > 70\% niche similarity, P < 0.005) than
   congeners (A. castelnaui and A. platana, 45\%, P < 0.005). ENMs of each
   species showed different responses to variations in environmental
   predictors, with A. castelnaui and R. agassizii showing higher
   probability of occurrence in shallower waters, closer to shore, while A.
   cyclophora and A. platana explore deeper areas, although still
   constrained to the continental shelf. We discuss how these differences
   influence the distribution of each species in the environment and used
   the phylogeny to argue that R. agassizii and A. castelnaui share a
   conserved niche from an ancestral lineage.},

Abstract = {An integrative approach by the congruence of genetics, morphology and
   ecological niche modelling (ENM) was used to delimit a new species
   ofHypanus(Rafinesque, 1818), a recently resurrected genus of marine
   stingrays comprising eight species, five of which occur in the western
   Atlantic. The species with the widest distribution,Hypanus
   americanus(Hildebrand and Schroeder, 1928), from the northeastern coast
   of the United States to southeastern Brazil, was demonstrated to be
   paraphyletic based on protein-coding mitochondrial genome analyses. This
   data set also indicates that the genetic distance between the new
   speciesHypanusberthalutzaesp. nov.and its three closely related species
   (H. americanus,H.longusandH.rudis) varies from 0.82\% to 3.14\%. In
   addition, Bayesian Analysis of Population Similarity using the
   mitochondrial genemt-nd2supports the separation ofH. berthalutzaesp.
   nov.(southwestern Atlantic) from its sister speciesH. rudis(eastern
   Atlantic). Similarly, morphological and morphometric analyses
   corroborated four morphotypes within theH. americanusspecies group and
   indicated the ventral caudal fold height and length and interspiracular
   and interorbital lengths as useful measurements to distinguish among
   them. Claspers of adult males also exhibit morphological differences
   among species. The ENM agreed with molecular and morphological analyses
   and delimits the distribution ofH. berthalutzaesp. nov.to shallow areas
   close to shore along the Brazilian coast, from the mouth of the Amazon
   River to Sao Paulo State, including the northeastern oceanic islands,
   suggesting that the great outflow of fresh water and sediments and the
   Mid-Atlantic Ridge might act as barriers. The integration of these data
   to describe a new species provides information relevant to their
   conservation status, because all species of theH. americanusspecies
   group are under the ``data-deficient{''} status.},

Abstract = {Conservation and management measures for large mobile sharks are more
   effective when information on migratory patterns and environmental cues
   are known. In the absence of long-term monitoring data or tracking
   programs, available information is based on occasional catch or sighting
   records from a variety of sources, usually constrained in space and
   time. This study demonstrates the utility of developing temporally
   explicit habitat suitability (HS) models to infer the migratory pattern
   of large mobile sharks. Bimonthly presence-only HS models (MaxEnt
   algorithm) were developed for the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus
   cepedianus) in the southwest Atlantic based on an exhaustive collection
   of data records and ecologically relevant predictors. The six final
   models showed good predictive power and were evaluated with independent
   data. A migratory pattern characterized by two main displacements was
   inferred from the models. We show that HS models can be applied as a
   no-cost, desk-based alternative to infer broadscale movements of large
   mobile sharks. This methodology is relevant as an important first step
   toward informing management plans in data-poor and financially limited
   regions or regions under urgent conservation need.},

Title = {Population expansion of the invasive Pomacentridae Chromis limbata

Abstract = {Human-mediated species invasions are recognized as a leading cause of
   global biotic homogenization and extinction. Studies on colonization
   events since early stages, establishment of new populations and range
   extension are scarce because of their rarity, difficult detection and
   monitoring. Chromis limbata is a reef-associated and non-migratory
   marine fish from the family Pomacentridae found in depths ranging
   between 3 and 45 m. The original distribution of the species encompassed
   exclusively the eastern Atlantic, including the Azores, Madeira and the
   Canary Islands. It is also commonly reported from West Africa between
   Senegal and Pointe Noire, Congo. In 2008, vagrant individuals of C.
   limbata were recorded off the east coast of Santa Catarina Island, South
   Brazil (27 degrees 41 ` 44 `' S, 48 degrees 27 ` 53 `' W). This study
   evaluated the increasing densities of C. limbata populations in Santa
   Catarina State shoreline. Two recent expansions, northwards to Sao Paulo
   State and southwards to Rio Grande do Sul State, are discussed, and a
   niche model of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) was performed to evaluate
   suitable C. limbata habitats. Brazilian populations are established and
   significantly increasing in most sites where the species has been
   detected. The distributional boundaries predicted by the model are
   clearly wider than their known range of occurrence, evidencing
   environmental suitability in both hemispheres from areas where the
   species still does not occur. Ecological processes such as competition,
   predation and specially habitat selectivity may regulate their
   populations and overall distribution range. A long-term monitoring
   programme and population genetics studies are necessary for a better
   understanding of this invasion and its consequences to natural
   communities.},

Title = {Potential distribution and population trends of the smalltail shark
   Carcharhinus porosus inferred from species distribution models and

Abstract = {Updated distribution ranges are crucial for conservation status
   assessments. Comprehensive analyses combining published literature and
   available data on historical catches and species distribution models
   (SDMs) are effective tools that could improve the prediction of more
   realistic scenarios for some species, especially those with limited
   information available and facing multiple threats. The present study
   aimed at generating an updated distribution for the smalltail shark
   Carcharhinus porosus, one of the most threatened and understudied shark
   species of the western Atlantic Ocean. Estimates of the key areas for
   this species conservation based on the SDMs, and trends in catch
   probabilities throughout its distribution range are provided. Four
   algorithms (BIOCLIM, Domain, Mahalanobis, and Maximum Entropy) were used
   to model the distribution of C. porosus and calculate its habitat
   suitability based on marine environmental variables. To assess
   historical catch probability trends, we built a generalized linear model
   from published and grey literature data. This analysis was used to
   estimate catch probability as an indication of population trends. SDMs
   suggest that the northern coast of South America (NCSA) harbours the
   most suitable habitats for C. porosus in the world, which was expected
   given its historically high catch rate in this region. In addition,
   there was a continuously declining catch probability trend starting in
   the 1970s. However, the decline was smaller for the NCSA as compared
   with the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern South America coast. Results
   indicate that the NCSA should be considered the currently most important
   area in the world for this species conservation. Furthermore, the lack
   of data throughout Central and South American marine regions hampers the
   evaluation of extinction risk throughout its updated distribution. Thus,
   research in these areas is urgently required for a more comprehensive
   conservation status assessment.},

Title = {How experimental physiology and ecological niche modelling can inform
   the management of marine bioinvasions?},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {700},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Marine bioinvasions are increasing worldwide by a number of factors
   related to the anthroposphere, such as higher ship traffic, climate
   change and biotic communities' alterations. Generating information about
   species with high invasive potential is necessary to inform management
   decisions aiming to prevent their arrival and spread. Grateloupia
   turuturu, one of the most harmful invasive macroalgae, is capable of
   damaging ecosystem functions and services, and causing biodiversity
   loss. Here we developed an ecological niche model using occurrence and
   environmental data to infer the potential global distribution of G.
   turuturu. In addition, ecophysiological experiments were performed with
   G. turuturu populations from different climatic regions to test
   predictions regarding invasion risk. Our model results show high
   suitability in temperate and warm temperate regions around the world,
   with special highlight to some areas where this species still doesn't
   occur. Thalli representing a potential temperate region origin, were
   held at 10, 13, 16, 20 and 24 degrees C, and measurements of optimal
   quantum field (Fv/Fm) demonstrated a decrease of photosynthetic yield in
   the higher temperature. Thalli from the population already established
   in warm temperate South Atlantic were held at 18, 24 and 30 degrees C
   with high and low nutrient conditions. This material exposed to the
   higher temperature demonstrated a drop in photosynthetic yield and
   significant reduction of growth rate. The congregation of modelling and
   physiological approach corroborate the invasive potential of G. turuturu
   and indicate higher invasion risk in temperate zones. Further
   discussions regarding management initiatives must be fostered to
   mitigate anthropogenic transport and eventually promote eradication
   initiatives in source areas, with special focus in the South America. We
   propose that this combined approach can be used to assess the potential
   distribution and establishment of other marine invasive species. (C)

   priority to better understand the regional distribution of cold-water
   corals (CWC). These organisms create some of the most species-rich
   habitats in the deep sea and, for this reason, they must be properly
   protected and managed. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable
   habitat for multiple CWC taxa off the Brazilian continental margin and
   compare their environmental niches. Habitat suitability models were
   developed using the Maxent approach, which allowed for the prediction of
   species distribution and for the identification of potential `hot spot'
   areas that may be important for biodiversity conservation. Ecological
   niches were determined by a PCA-env approach, and niche similarity and
   equivalence were evaluated based on niche overlap using the Schoener's D
   metric. Potentially suitable habitat for Octocorallia covered a broad
   latitudinal range encompassing nearly the entire Brazilian continental
   margin, whereas Scleractinia had greater potentially suitable habitat in
   the Central and Southern areas. Scleractinian species were observed to
   slightly differ in their environmental niche, with non-reef-forming
   species being more tolerant to a wider range of environmental conditions
   in comparison with reef-forming species, inhabiting a wider area of the
   South American continental margin. Due to the high potential suitability
   for several CWC species, the Central and Southern parts of the Brazilian
   continental margin should be considered as potential areas high CWC
   diversity. Considering the current state of the art and strategic
   assessment tools, these areas are important targets for conservation,
   management, and environmental impact assessment. Most reef-forming
   species had similar but not directly equivalent ecological niches,
   indicating that mapping efforts and management planning should consider
   CWCs at the species level.},

Abstract = {Many developing countries lack information to manage their endangered
   species, urging the need for affordable and reliable information. We
   used Bayesian hierarchical spatial models, with oceanographic variables,
   to predict the distribution range of Epinephelus marginatus, the dusky
   grouper, for the entire Southwest Atlantic. Weran a model using
   scientific information gathered from the literature and another using
   information gathered from fishers on species presence or absence. In
   both models, temperature was an important determinant of species
   occurrence. The predicted occurrence of the dusky grouper overlapped
   widely (Schoener's D = 0.71; Warren's I = 0.91) between the models,
   despite small differences on the southern and northern extremes of the
   distribution. These results suggest that basic information provided by
   fishers on species occurrence in their area can be reliable enough to
   predict species occurrence over large scales and can be potentially
   useful for marine spatial planning. Fishers' knowledge may be an even
   more viable alternative to data collection than what was previously
   thought, for countries that both struggle with financial limitations and
   have urgent conservation needs.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the movements of small seabirds during migration,
   but such information is important for their conservation. Leach's Storm
   Petrel Oceanodroma leucorhoa is the most abundant seabird in Atlantic
   Canada, but its population has declined in recent years. Here, we
   describe trans-equatorial and trans-Atlantic migration movements of 13
   Leach's Storm Petrels, which were tracked with geolocators from two
   breeding colonies in Nova Scotia, Canada: Bon Portage Island and Country
   Island. Our results indicate that Leach's Storm Petrels have low
   migratory connectivity and that they use multiple stopover areas and
   overwintering destinations. Birds with stopover areas at higher
   latitudes overwintered in the North Atlantic Ocean, either in areas
   associated with the North Equatorial Current or in waters off
   Newfoundland and Labrador. Birds with lower-latitude stopover areas
   overwintered in the South Atlantic Ocean, in areas associated with the
   Benguela Current off southwestern Africa. We observed greater delta N-15
   values (indicating a higher trophic level) in feathers from birds that
   migrated south compared to birds that stayed in the Northern Hemisphere,
   but we observed no difference in delta C-13 (which may be interpreted in
   multiple ways). Species distribution modelling using remotely sensed
   oceanographic data indicated that high sea surface temperatures and high
   chlorophyll a concentrations were important predictors of habitat use in
   winter.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},

Abstract = {Early detection and rapid response are essential to prevent invasive
   species from thriving in marine environments following their
   introduction. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to
   predict the potential distribution of invasive species, providing
   excellent tools for the design of strategies to prevent or mitigate
   impacts of non-native species. Niche shifts are among the major
   drawbacks in the use of SDMs, leading scientists to formulate inaccurate
   predictions. In this work, we tested the performance of 3 different SDMs
   (Bioclim, Mahalanobis distance and Maxent) to predict the distribution
   of a niche-shifting invasive species using native data only. As a model
   organism, we used the neurotoxic sea-slug Pleurobranchaea maculata,
   which was recently introduced into the southwestern Atlantic, where it
   has undergone a niche shift. Our results show that Maxent outperforms
   the other modeling techniques in predicting the invasive distribution,
   but that Bioclim provides the most accurate outputs, minimizing over-
   and underpredictions. Our study strongly suggests that niche
   decomposition can provide important evidence for the underlying causes
   of niche shifts, aiding our understanding of why they occur and how they
   can be addressed by SDMs. This approach will improve the interpretation
   of SDMs in order to predict the potential spread of invasive species
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {Insights into the year-round movements and behaviour of seabirds are
   essential to better understand their ecology and to evaluate possible
   threats at sea. The Atlantic petrel Pterodroma incerta is an Endangered
   gadfly petrel endemic to the South Atlantic Ocean, with virtually the
   entire population breeding on Gough Island (Tristan da Cunha
   archipelago). We describe adult phenology, habitat preferences and
   at-sea activity patterns for each phenological phase of the annual cycle
   and refine current knowledge about its distribution, by using
   light-level geolocators on 13 adults over 1-3 consecutive years. We also
   ascertained moulting pattern through stable isotope analysis (SIA) of
   nitrogen and carbon in feathers from 8 carcasses. On average, adults
   started their post-breeding migration on 25 December, taking 10 d to
   reach their non-breeding areas on the South American shelf slope. The
   pre-breeding migration started around 11 April and took 5 d. From
   phenological data, we found evidence of carry-over effects between
   successive breeding periods. The year-round distribution generally
   coincided with the potential distribution obtained from habitat
   modelling, except during the non-breeding and pre-laying exodus periods,
   when birds only used the western areas of the South Atlantic. Moulting
   occurred during the non-breeding period, when birds spent more time on
   the water, and results from SIA helped us to distinguish feathers grown
   around Gough Island from those grown in the non-breeding area. Overall,
   our results bring important new insights into the spatial ecology of
   this Endangered seabird, which should help improve conservation
   strategies in the South Atlantic Ocean.},

Title = {Reassessment of the franciscana Pontoporia blainvillei (Gervais \&

Abstract = {The franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) is the most threatened small
   cetacean of South America. The species is endemic to coastal waters of
   the western South Atlantic Ocean, where it is distributed from Itaunas
   (Brazil) to Golfo San Matias (Argentina). Its range was divided in four
   Franciscana Management Areas (FMAs) for conservation purposes. However,
   the distribution of the franciscana is not continuous along its range,
   with two hiatuses proposed in southeastern Brazilian coast. The absence
   of franciscana records in these regions has been confirmed by multiple
   years of research, however the reasons for this discontinuous
   distribution is not well understood. In this study, information on the
   distribution of the franciscana in south and southeastern Brazil is
   updated and new limits for FMAs are proposed. NicheA 3.0 software was
   used to investigate the environmental suitability of distributional gaps
   in relation to four weakly correlated, allegedly relevant descriptors of
   franciscana's distribution. In total, 788 records from dedicated aerial
   and boat surveys and bycatch were used to verify and to confirm the new
   FMAs limits proposed by franciscana's experts previously. The
   distributional gaps were reshaped and defined as following: Gap I from
   Piraque-Acu River Mouth, Santa Cruz (19 degrees 57'S) in the state of
   Espirito Santo to Barra de Itabapoana (21 degrees 18'S) in the state of
   Rio de Janeiro; and Gap II from Armacao dos Buzios (22 degrees 44'S) to
   Piraquara de Dentro (22 degrees 59'S) in Rio de Janeiro. The ecological
   niche model indicated that distributional gaps are inside franciscanas
   fundamental niche, and are relatively suitable in terms of salinity,
   temperature, diffuse attenuation and bathymetry. However, the narrow of
   continental shelf seems to be the main factor explaining the absence of
   franciscanas in the distributional gaps as well as for the
   differentiation of some of the FMAs proposed. Narrowness of continental
   shelf seems to be intensifying the dynamics of biotic interactions
   promoting food competition for example, and/or causing geographic
   limitation to maintain minimal viable population size in present or past
   times periods.},

Abstract = {With increasing pressure on the oceans from environmental change, there
   has been a global call for improved protection of marine ecosystems
   through the implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we
   used species distribution modelling (SDM) of tracking data from 14
   seabird species to identify key marine areas in the southwest Atlantic
   Ocean, valuing areas based on seabird species occurrence, seasonality
   and extinction risk. We also compared overlaps between the outputs
   generated by the SDM and layers representing important human threats
   (fishing intensity, ship density, plastic and oil pollution, ocean
   acidification), and calculated loss in conservation value using fishing
   and ship density as cost layers. The key marine areas were located on
   the southern Patagonian Shelf, overlapping extensively with areas of
   high fishing activity, and did not change seasonally, while seasonal
   areas were located off south and southeast Brazil and overlapped with
   areas of high plastic pollution and ocean acidification. Non-seasonal
   key areas were located off northeast Brazil on an area of high
   biodiversity, and with relatively low human impacts. We found support
   for the use of seasonal areas depending on the seabird assemblage used,
   because there was a loss in conservation value for the seasonal compared
   to the non-seasonal approach when using cost' layers. Our approach,
   accounting for seasonal changes in seabird assemblages and their risk of
   extinction, identified additional candidate areas for incorporation in
   the network of pelagic MPAs.},

   habitat suitability (HS) maps. Here, we determined the factors affecting
   distribution of southern giant petrels (SGP) from northern Patagonian
   colonies (Isla Arce: 45 degrees 00'S; 65 degrees 29'W, and Isla Gran
   Robredo: 45 degrees 08'S; 66 degrees 03'W) using ENFA, improving
   estimates of their potential year-round feeding habitats. Data on
   movements of 17 adult and 9 first-year juvenile SGP were gathered using
   satellite telemetry. Model ecogeographical variables (EGV) overlapped
   the tracked animals. The resulting HS maps included most of the tracking
   locations along the Argentinean Shelf and reflected characteristics that
   congregate procellariiformes elsewhere. Wind conditions and primary
   productivity shaped foraging HS of petrels over the year. However,
   different EGVs influenced this population differently depending on the
   requirements of their life stage. For example, juveniles showed high
   marginality ( values of EGVs different from the mean values available).
   Breeding adults' HS was determined by a small range of values within
   those available, showing high specializations. Contrarily, wintering

Title = {Spatial Models of Abundance and Habitat Preferences of Commerson's and
   Peale's Dolphin in Southern Patagonian Waters},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Commerson's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus c. commersonii) and Peale's
   dolphins (Lagenorhynchus australis) are two of the most common species
   of cetaceans in the coastal waters of southwest South Atlantic Ocean.
   Both species are listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN, mainly due to the
   lack of information about population sizes and trends. The goal of this
   study was to build spatially explicit models for the abundance of both
   species in relation to environmental variables using data collected
   during eight scientific cruises along the Patagonian shelf. Spatial
   models were constructed using generalized additive models. In total, 88
   schools (212 individuals) of Commerson's dolphin and 134 schools (465
   individuals) of Peale's dolphin were recorded in 8,535 km surveyed.
   Commerson's dolphin was found less than 60 km from shore; whereas
   Peale's dolphins occurred over a wider range of distances from the
   coast, the number of animals sighted usually being larger near or far
   from the coast. Fitted models indicate overall abundances of
   approximately 22,000 Commerson's dolphins and 20,000 Peale's dolphins in
   the total area studied. This work provides the first large-scale
   abundance estimate for Peale's dolphin in the Atlantic Ocean and an
   update of population size for Commerson's dolphin. Additionally, our
   results contribute to baseline data on suitable habitat conditions for
   both species in southern Patagonia, which is essential for the
   implementation of adequate conservation measures.},

Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are tools to obtain habitat
   suitability maps based on historical species occurrences and
   environmental variables. Those maps can be used to restrict fishing
   grounds or to assist in planning and reserve selection. This is
   especially important for species at risk of extinction. We developed
   SDMs for five endangered elasmobranch species, namely Squatina
   guggenheim, S. occulta, Rhinobatos horkelii, Galeorhinus galeus, and
   Mustelus schmitti, using Boosted Regression Trees. Data from 1,704
   bottom trawls carried out between 1972 and 2005 as part of research
   surveys on the southern Brazilian shelf between 28A degrees 36'S and 33A
   degrees 45'S, combined with satellite imagery and environmental atlases,
   were used in the models. Based on 10-fold cross-validation statistics,
   all models had a reasonable performance, though S. guggenheim models had
   an excellent discrimination (AUC > 0.9) and R. horkelii models had just
   a fair discriminatory power (AUC 0.7-0.8). Except for R. horkelii, all
   models showed good association between observed and predicted
   occurrences (PBC > 0.5). Squatina guggenheim models provided the
   greatest explained deviance (49-54\%), whereas R. horkelii models the
   smallest (14-17\%). Models' predictions were consistent with the current
   knowledge of all species. Moreover, those models made reasonable
   predictions using the great spatial and temporal coverage of satellite
   data.},

Title = {Modeling suitable habitat of invasive red lionfish Pterois volitans

Abstract = {We used two common correlative species-distribution models to predict
   suitable habitat of invasive red lionfish Pterois volitans (Linnaeus,
   1758) in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans. The
   Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) model
   were applied using the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling. We
   compared models developed using native occurrences, using non-native
   occurrences, and using both native and non-native occurrences. Models
   were trained using occurrence data collected before 2010 and evaluated
   with occurrence data collected from the invaded range during or after
   2010. We considered a total of 22 marine environmental variables. Models
   built with non-native only or both native and non-native occurrence data
   outperformed those that used only native occurrences. Evaluation metrics
   based on the independent test data were highest for models that used
   both native and non-native occurrences. Bathymetry was the strongest
   environmental predictor for all models and showed increasing suitability
   as ocean floor depth decreased, with salinity ranking the second
   strongest predictor for models that used native and both native and
   non-native occurrences, indicating low habitat suitability for
   salinities < 30. Our model results also suggest that red lionfish could
   continue to invade southern latitudes in the western Atlantic Ocean and
   may establish localized populations in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We
   reiterate the importance in the choice of the training data source
   (native, non-native, or native/non-native) used to develop correlative
   species distribution models for invasive species.},

Title = {Distribution of megafaunal species in the Southwestern Atlantic: key
   ecological areas and opportunities for marine conservation},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {73},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1579-1588},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {During the last centuries, populations of marine megafauna-such as
   seabirds, turtles, and mammals-were intensively exploited. At present,
   other threats such as bycatch and pollution affect these species, which
   play key ecological roles in marine ecosystems as apex consumers and/or
   nutrient transporters. This study analyses the distribution of six
   megafaunal species (Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, Dermochelys
   coriacea, Thalassarche melanophris, Otaria flavescens, and Arctocephalus
   australis) coexisting in the Southwestern Atlantic to discuss their
   protection in terms of current management strategies in the region.
   Through the prediction of the species potential distributions and their
   relation to bathymetry, sea temperature and oceanographic fronts, key
   ecological areas are defined from a multi-taxa perspective. Information
   on the distribution of 70 individuals (18 sea turtles, 19 albatrosses,
   and 33 otariids) was obtained through satellite tracking conducted
   during 2007-2013 and analysed using a Geographic Information System and
   maximum entropy models. During the autumn-winter period, megafaunal
   species were distributed over the continental shelves of Argentina,
   Uruguay, and Brazil, mainly over the Argentine Exclusive Economic Zone
   and the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone. Despite some differences,
   all megafaunal species seems to have similar environmental requirements
   during the autumn-winter period. Mostly waters shallower than 50 m were
   identified as key ecological areas, with the Rio de la Plata as the
   habitat with the highest suitability for all the species. This area is
   highly productive and sustains the main coastal fisheries of Uruguay and
   Argentina, yet its role as a key ecological area for megafaunal species
   has been underestimated until now. This approach provides a basis to
   analyse the effect of anthropic activities on megafaunal species through
   risk maps and, ultimately, to generate knowledge to improve national and
   bi-national management plans between Argentina and Uruguay.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since the Moreno's et al. (2005) work, no study was done to update the
   distribution patterns of Stenella dolphins in the southwestern Atlantic
   Ocean. Ecological niche modeling was used to redefine the distribution
   patterns of Stenella dolphins in this area of Atlantic Ocean. Maximum
   entropy method (Maxent) was employed to generate models using a set of
   environmental variables as explanatory variables of the location records
   obtained by sighting and accidental captures. All ecological niche
   models performed returned AUC values >0.9. Areas with high environmental
   suitability for pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata),
   Clymene dolphin (Stenella clymene) and spinner dolphins (Stenella
   longirostris) are found in warm (>25 degrees C) and deep waters (>= 1000
   m). High environmental suitability for Atlantic spotted dolphin
   (Stenella frontalis) seems to occur between 20.5 degrees S and 30
   degrees S in the southeastern Brazilian coastal waters. The projected
   maps of species distributions showed patterns closely related to
   environmental changes at a fine spatial scale and added valuable
   information about the offshore limits of those oceanic species. The
   results suggest that the different species of Stenella have distinct
   environmental requirements in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. (C) 2015

Abstract = {The distribution of the planktivorous basking shark Cetorhinus maximus
   is influenced by zooplankton abundance at small scales and temperature
   at medium scales in the North Atlantic. Here, we estimate the
   distribution of basking sharks on South Atlantic continental shelves,
   and the relative importance of chlorophyll concentration, as a proxy for
   zooplankton abundance, and temperature in determining habitat
   suitability for basking sharks at large scales. We used maximum entropy
   (MaxEnt) and maximum likelihood (MaxLike) species distribution modelling
   to test three hypotheses: the distribution of basking sharks is
   determined by (1) temperature, (2) chlorophyll concentration, or (3)
   both chlorophyll and temperature, while considering other factors, such
   as oxygen and salinity. Off South America, basking shark habitat
   included subtropical, temperate and cool-temperate waters between
   approximately 20 degrees S and 55 degrees S. Off Africa, basking shark
   habitat was limited to cool-temperate waters off Namibia and southern
   South Africa. MaxLike models had a better fit than MaxEnt models. The
   best model included minimum chlorophyll concentration, dissolved oxygen
   concentration, and sea surface temperature range, supporting hypothesis
   3. However, of all variables included in the best model, minimum
   chlorophyll concentration had the highest influence on basking shark
   distribution. Unlike the North Atlantic distribution, the South Atlantic
   distribution of basking sharks includes subtropical and cool-temperate
   waters. This difference is explained by high minimum chlorophyll
   concentration off southern Brazil as compared to North Atlantic
   subtropical areas. Observations in other regions of the world support
   this conclusion. The highest habitat suitability for basking sharks is
   located close to nearshore areas that experience high anthropogenic
   impact {[}Current Zoology 61 (5): 811-826, 2015].},

Abstract = {The subtropical and temperate coastal waters of the western South
   Atlantic are an important calving ground for southern right whales,
   Eubalaena australis. From 2002 to 2008, data on right whale distribution
   and habitat characteristics were collected in 14 bays along the
   coastline of Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Generalized linear models
   with a negative binomial error distribution were used to determine which
   environmental (beach morphotype, bay mouth width, bay inclination angle,
   north-south and east-west wind components), and temporal (month and
   year) variables best explained the aggregation pattern of individuals.
   Our results suggested that both cow-calf pairs and adults unaccompanied
   by calves prefer bays with dissipative beaches, and that cow-calf pairs
   apparently avoid bays facing southeast during days of strong east-west
   winds. The number of sightings peaked in September and tended to
   increase over the study period. One particular embayment (Ribanceira
   beach) had considerably higher numbers of animals and may be considered
   a preferred spot in this calving ground. Our findings contribute to a
   better understanding of the species' habitat use and ecological
   requirements and should be taken into account if new management measures
   are implemented to further increase protection of southern right whales
   in the region.},

Title = {Leapfrog migration and habitat preferences of a small oceanic seabird,
   Bulwer's petrel (Bulweria bulwerii)},

Abstract = {AimOur current understanding of migratory strategies and the reasons for
   their high variability along the phylogenetic tree remains relatively
   poor. Most of the hypotheses relating to migration have been formulated
   for terrestrial taxa; classically, oceanic migrations were considered as
   merely dispersive because of the scarcity of observations in the open
   ocean. We describe for the first time, the migration strategy of a small
   seabird, the Bulwer's petrel (Bulweria bulwerii), and provide new
   insights into the ecology and evolution of long-distance marine
   migrations.
   LocationSubtropical and tropical Atlantic Ocean.
   MethodsUsing cutting-edge geolocators, we examined the year-round
   distribution and at-sea activity patterns of adult Bulwer's petrels
   sampled at five localities throughout the species' breeding range in the
   Atlantic, within the Azores, Salvages, Canary and Cape Verde
   archipelagos. We assessed the migratory connectivity of the species and
   its habitat use at population and metapopulation scales.
   ResultsOur results provide the first evidence of an oriented leapfrog
   migration in oceanic seabirds. Ecological niche models based on
   breeding-season data effectively predicted that subtropical waters of
   the South Atlantic would be the preferred habitat for the northern
   populations of Bulwer's petrels during the non-breeding season. Habitat
   modelling also highlighted similarities in distributions between the
   breeding and non-breeding periods for the southern populations. Data on
   at-sea activity patterns suggested that birds from the northern and
   southern populations behave differently during the breeding season, as
   well as in the northern and southern non-breeding ranges during the
   non-breeding period.
   Main conclusionsThese results indicate that specific habitat
   preferences, presumably related to differences in prey availability,
   explain the observed distributions and hence the pattern of leapfrog
   migration described for Bulwer's petrel. Our study demonstrates the
   utility of integrating diverse tracking data from multiple populations
   across international boundaries, and habitat modelling, for identifying
   important areas common to many marine species in the vast oceanic
   environments.},

Abstract = {Tubastraea tagusensis, a coral native to the Galapagos Archipelago, has
   successfully established and invaded the Brazilian coast where it
   modifies native tropical rocky shore and coral reef communities. In
   order to understand the processes underlying the establishment of
   T.tagusensis, we tested whether Maxent, a tool for species distribution
   modeling, based on the native range of T.tagusensis correctly forecasted
   the invasion range of this species in Brazil. The Maxent algorithm was
   unable to predict the Brazilian coast as a suitable environment for the
   establishment of T.tagusensis. A comparison between these models and a
   principal component analysis (PCA) allowed us to examine the
   environmental dissimilarity between the two occupied regions (native and
   invaded) and to assess the species' occupied niche breadth. According to
   the PCA results, lower levels of chlorophyll-a and nitrate on the
   Atlantic coast segregate the Brazilian and Galapagos environments,
   implying that T.tagusensis may have expanded its realized niche during
   the invasion process. We tested the possible realized niche expansion in
   T.tagusensis by assuming that Tubastraea spp. have similar fundamental
   niches, which was supported by exploring the environmental space of
   T.coccinea, a tropical-cosmopolitan congener of T.tagusensis. We believe
   that the usage of Maxent should be treated with caution, especially when
   applied to biological invasion (or climate change) scenarios where the
   target species has a highly localized native (original) distribution,
   which may represent only a small portion of its fundamental niche, and
   therefore a violation of a SDM assumption.},

Title = {Half a World Apart? Overlap in Nonbreeding Distributions of Atlantic and
   Indian Ocean Thin-Billed Prions},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Distant populations of animals may share their non-breeding grounds or
   migrate to distinct areas, and this may have important consequences for
   population differentiation and dynamics. Small burrow-nesting seabirds
   provide a suitable case study, as they are often restricted to safe
   breeding sites on islands, resulting in a patchy breeding distribution.
   For example, Thin-billed prions Pachyptila belcheri have two major
   breeding colonies more than 8,000 km apart, on the Falkland Islands in
   the south-western Atlantic and in the Kerguelen Archipelago in the
   Indian Ocean. We used geolocators and stable isotopes to compare at-sea
   movements and trophic levels of these two populations during their
   nonbreeding season, and applied ecological niche models to compare
   environmental conditions in the habitat. Over three winters, birds
   breeding in the Atlantic showed a high consistency in their migration
   routes. Most individuals migrated more than 3000 km eastwards, while
   very few remained over the Patagonian Shelf. In contrast, all Indian
   Ocean birds migrated westwards, resulting in an overlapping nonbreeding
   area in the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Geolocators
   and isotopic signature of feathers indicated that prions from the
   Falklands moulted at slightly higher latitudes than those from Kerguelen
   Islands. All birds fed on low trophic level prey, most probably
   crustaceans. The phenology differed notably between the two populations.
   Falkland birds returned to the Patagonian Shelf after 2-3 months, while
   Kerguelen birds remained in the nonbreeding area for seven months,
   before returning to nesting grounds highly synchronously and at high
   speed. Habitat models identified sea surface temperature and chlorophyll
   a concentration as important environmental parameters. In summary, we
   show that even though the two very distant populations migrate to
   roughly the same area to moult, they have distinct wintering strategies:
   They had significantly different realized niches and timing which may
   contribute to spatial niche partitioning.},

Title = {Post-Fledging Dispersal of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) from
   Two Breeding Sites in the South Atlantic},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Most studies concerning the foraging ecology of marine vertebrates are
   limited to breeding adults, although other life history stages might
   comprise half the total population. For penguins, little is known about
   juvenile dispersal, a period when individuals may be susceptible to
   increased mortality given their naive foraging behaviour. Therefore, we
   used satellite telemetry to study king penguin fledglings (n = 18) from
   two sites in the Southwest Atlantic in December 2007. The two sites
   differed with respect to climate and proximity to the Antarctic Polar
   Front (APF), a key oceanographic feature generally thought to be
   important for king penguin foraging success. Accordingly, birds from
   both sites foraged predominantly in the vicinity of the APF. Eight king
   penguins were tracked for periods greater than 120 days; seven of these
   (three from the Falkland Islands and four from South Georgia) migrated
   into the Pacific. Only one bird from the Falkland Islands moved into the
   Indian Ocean, visiting the northern limit of the winter pack-ice. Three
   others from the Falkland Islands migrated to the eastern coast of Tierra
   del Fuego before travelling south. Derived tracking parameters
   describing their migratory behaviour showed no significant differences
   between sites. Nevertheless, generalized linear habitat modelling
   revealed that juveniles from the Falkland Islands spent more time in
   comparatively shallow waters with low sea surface temperature, sea
   surface height and chlorophyll variability. Birds from South Georgia
   spent more time in deeper waters with low sea surface temperature and
   sea surface height, but high concentrations of chlorophyll. Our results
   indicate that inexperienced king penguins, irrespective of the location
   of their natal site in relation to the position of the APF, develop
   their foraging skills progressively over time, including specific
   adaptations to the environment around their prospective breeding site.},

Abstract = {Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT) has always displayed spectacular changes in
   its spatial distribution, but the underlying mechanism of such
   variations still remains obscure. This study focuses on this challenging
   issue by scrutinizing the intriguing Brazilian episode' during which a
   large quantity of ABFT (a temperate species) was caught during the 1960s
   in the equatorial Atlantic. To investigate this event, we applied a
   niche model to an extensive data set of catch and environmental
   variables from 1960 to 2009. ABFT exhibited a remarkably large
   ecological niche, which matches well with our current knowledge of ABFT.
   Our results also depicted a high probability of ABFT occurrence in the
   South Atlantic and, more interestingly, favorable environmental
   conditions in the western equatorial Atlantic during the 1960s, but not
   later. ABFT could thus have migrated from their northern spawning
   grounds to the South Atlantic during the 1960s through the western
   equatorial Atlantic, playing the role of an ecological bridge'. We argue
   that the rarity of ABFT in the southern Atlantic during the last four
   decades would result from the interaction of several processes,
   particularly oceanographic conditions, migratory behavior,
   density-dependence, exploitation levels and population structure.
   Examination of the catch data further indicated that the fish caught in
   the equatorial Atlantic were from the western stock and we concluded
   that the lack of rebuilding of this stock could result from a regime
   shift due to the combination of oceanographic changes in the equatorial
   Atlantic and overfishing in the North Atlantic in the 1960s and 1970s.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal trends of sailfish catch rates in the southwestern
   and equatorial Atlantic Ocean in relation to environmental variables
   were investigated using generalized additive models and
   fishery-dependent data. Two generalized additive models were fit: (i)
   spatio-temporal', including only latitude, longitude, month, and year;
   and (ii) oceanographic', including sea surface temperature (SST),
   chlorophyll-a concentration, wind velocity, bottom depth, and depth of
   mixed layer and year. The spatio-temporal model explained more (average
   similar to 40\%) of the variability in catch rates than the
   oceanographic model (average similar to 30\%). Modeled catch rate
   predictions showed that sailfish tend to aggregate off the southeast
   coast of Brazil during the peak of the spawning season (November to
   February). Sailfish also seem to aggregate for feeding in two different
   areas, one located in the mid-west Atlantic to the south of similar to
   15 degrees S and another area off the north coast of Brazil. The
   oceanographic model revealed that wind velocity and chlorophyll-a
   concentration were the most important variables describing catch rate
   variability. The results presented herein may help to understand
   sailfish movements in the Atlantic Ocean and the relationship of these
   movements with environmental effects.},

Abstract = {The family Bougainvilliidae comprises a group of anthoathecate
   hydrozoans that is biologically, ecologically and biogeographically
   poorly understood, and consequently, poorly taxonomically organized.
   Here, our goal is to synthesize knowledge of the family from an
   historical perspective, and to analyze their potential distribution
   based on their ecology. We analyzed all the available information on the
   family (based on 303 articles and databases), comprising 15 genera and
   97 valid species in five oceans. Two temporal peaks (1900 and 2000) in
   publications are dominated by records of meroplanktonic species. The
   coastal zone has the most frequently reported occurrences. The widest
   latitudinal ranges are found in the genera Bimeria and Bougainvillia.
   Ecological niche modeling of 25 species (MaxEnt algorithm) finds that
   chlorophyll is the most important variable that influences the
   distribution of the family. Five possible latitudinal distributional
   patterns are derived from the model, dominated by the subtropical-polar
   distribution.},

Abstract = {Distribution modeling is a relatively new tool to study cetaceans
   distribution and is used to understand their relationships with the
   habitat, which in turn, can be used for several purposes. This is the
   first attempt to model Tursiops truncatus distribution in South-
   Atlantic Ocean. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was developed to
   investigate how the distribution of T truncatus in Cabo Frio, Brazil,
   during summer (December to February) is influenced by depth, distance to
   coast, slope,. Furthermore, we tested the efficiency of a model with
   number of groups (total occurrence) as response variable compared to a
   presence-absence data. Our results indicated that total occurrence model
   was more robust than presence-absence. Dolphins were found regarding to
   depth most frequently around 30-60 m and decreasing in more profound
   depths. Dolphins occurrence decreased as distance to coast increased.
   Our results show that Cabo Frio is an important site for I truncatus
   since it may provides feeding resources and a safe place against
   predators. However the fast development of human activities may threaten
   this important area and therefore this dolphin species in Brazilian
   waters.},

Title = {Year-round distribution suggests spatial segregation of two small petrel

Abstract = {Aim Pelagic seabirds exploit large areas of ocean when acting as
   central-place foragers during the breeding season, and ranges are even
   more extensive outside the breeding period. Spatial niche partitioning
   is known to occur among species that breed sympatrically, but is less
   apparent during the non-breeding period when there is increased
   potential for overlap among closely related species from neighbouring
   island groups. This applies to several species of prion, Pachyptila
   spp., in the Southern Ocean; although extremely abundant, their at-sea
   distribution was virtually unknown because they are difficult to
   distinguish while at sea. To understand spatial niche partitioning at
   large scales, we investigated the year-round distribution of thin-billed
   prions (Pachyptila belcheri) from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
   and Antarctic prions (Pachyptiladesolata) from South Georgia. Location
   South Atlantic Ocean. Methods Recently, geolocation devices have become
   small enough to be deployed on small seabirds. During 200910, we tracked
   20 thin-billed prions and 9 Antarctic prions with miniaturized
   geolocators. We applied ecological niche models to compare environmental
   conditions in the habitat utilized year-round. Results We show that two
   prion species from the south-west Atlantic Ocean have divergent patterns
   of migration, and that this has resulted in nearly complete spatial
   segregation (05\% overlap by month in the 95\% kernel density polygons).
   Nineteen of 20 thin-billed prions migrated to an area >3000km east of
   their breeding site, whereas all Antarctic prions migrated a much
   shorter distance, and to the north-west. The non-breeding distribution
   of thin-billed prions included the waters around South Georgia, but only
   when the Antarctic prions were absent. The models highlighted large
   differences in the realized niche between the two species, and between
   the habitat characteristics of breeding and non-breeding areas of
   thin-billed and Antarctic prions. Main conclusions Our results are
   consistent with the prediction that spatial niche partitioning occurs at
   large scales, allowing the co-existence of related species. The methods
   applied here will enable predictive maps of the distributions of other
   prion populations to be created, once data become available from other
   breeding sites in the Southern Ocean.},

Title = {Invasive potential of the coral Tubastraea coccinea in the southwest
   Atlantic},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {480},
Pages = {73-81},
Abstract = {The orange cup coral Tubastraea coccinea was the first scleractinean to
   invade the western Atlantic. The species occurs throughout the Gulf of
   Mexico and the Caribbean Sea and has now established itself in the
   southwest Atlantic along the Brazilian coast. T. coccinea modifies
   native benthic communities, competes with an endemic coral species and
   demonstrates widespread invasive potential. We used species distribution
   modeling (SDM) to predict climatically suitable habitats for T. coccinea
   along the coastline of the southwestern Atlantic and identify the extent
   of the putative effects of this species on the native coral Mussismilia
   hispida by estimating areas of potential overlap between these species.
   The resulting SDMs predicted a large area of climatically suitable
   habitat available for invasion by T. coccinea and also predicted
   widespread occurrence of the endemic M. hispida along the Brazilian
   coast. The prediction of the T. coccinea distribution model suggests
   that suitable environmental conditions for the species occur throughout
   most of the littoral zone, including most of Brazil's marine protected
   areas. The overlap of the SDMs of M. hispida and T. coccinea revealed a
   large area with high habitat suitability for both species. Considering
   the invasive potential of T. coccinea and its ecological consequences,
   we concluded that this alien species could change the benthic
   communities of most of the shallow Brazilian coast and, as the invasive
   and native coral species have been shown to be antagonistic, T. coccinea
   represents a serious threat to M. hispida throughout most of its
   potential geographical distribution.},

Title = {Global habitat suitability of cold-water octocorals},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aim Three-quarters of Octocorallia species are found in deep waters.
   These cold-water octocoral colonies can form a major constituent of
   structurally complex habitats. The global distribution and the habitat
   requirements of deep-sea octocorals are poorly understood given the
   expense and difficulties of sampling at depth. Habitat suitability
   models are useful tools to extrapolate distributions and provide an
   understanding of ecological requirements. Here, we present global
   habitat suitability models and distribution maps for seven suborders of
   Octocorallia: Alcyoniina, Calcaxonia, Holaxonia, Scleraxonia,
   Sessiliflorae, Stolonifera and Subselliflorae. Location Global. Methods
   We use maximum entropy modelling to predict octocoral distribution using
   a database of 12,508 geolocated octocoral specimens and 32 environmental
   grids resampled to 30 arc-second (approximately 1 km2) resolution.
   Additionally, a meta-analysis determined habitat preferences and niche
   overlap between the different suborders of octocorals. Results Suborder
   Sessiliflorae had the widest potential habitat range, but all records
   for all suborders implied a habitat preference for continental shelves
   and margins, particularly the North and West Atlantic and Western
   Pacific Rim. Temperature, salinity, broad scale slope, productivity,
   oxygen and calcite saturation state were identified as important factors
   for determining habitat suitability. Less than 3\% of octocoral records
   were found in waters undersaturated for calcite, but this result is
   affected by a shallow-water sampling bias. Main conclusions The
   logistical difficulties, expense and vast areas associated with deep-sea
   sampling leads to a gap in the knowledge of faunal distributions that is
   difficult to fill without predictive modelling. Global distribution
   estimates are presented, highlighting many suitable areas which have yet
   to be studied. We suggest that approximately 17\% of oceans are suitable
   for at least one suborder but 3.5\% may be suitable for all seven. This
   is the first global habitat suitability modelling study on the
   distribution of octocorals and forms a useful resource for researchers,
   managers and conservationists.},

Abstract = {Swordfish, Xiphias gladius, is a highly migratory species of important
   commercial value and widely distributed in three oceans. Recently, the
   South Atlantic swordfish captured as by-catch in longline fisheries
   targeting tunas has contributed greatly to the overall Atlantic
   swordfish's landing. In this study, we have developed a habitat
   suitability index (HSI) model to examine the relationships between their
   spatio-temporal distribution and environmental factors and to identify
   potential fishing grounds for the swordfish in the South Atlantic Ocean
   using the Taiwanese distant-water longline fishery data and
   remote-sensing oceanographic data for 1998-2007. All the environmental
   factors considered - sea surface temperature (SST), mixed layer depth
   (MLD), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), chlorophyll-a concentration
   (CHA) and ocean bathymetry (BAH) - were highly significant with most of
   the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) variation explained by SST. The most
   optimum habitat (i.e. hotspot) was found in the areas with SSTs of 27-28
   degrees C, SSHAs of -0.05 to 0.05 m, CHAs of 0.1-0.2 mg m(-3) and BAHs
   of -4000 to -4500 m. The arithmetic mean model with five environmental
   variables was found to be the most appropriate according to the
   information theory based on the evaluation of different empirical HSI
   models in combination with different environmental factors. The
   bimonthly geographic information system maps of the predicted HSI values
   were cross-validated by the observed CPUE, suggesting that the model can
   be used as a tool for reliable prediction of potential fishing grounds.
   Because the distribution and relative abundance of swordfish are
   sufficiently heterogeneous in space and time, the output of this study
   could provide a scientific basis for time-area closures based management
   of this species.},

Abstract = {Generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction was applied to
   catch per unit effort (cpue) data for blue shark (Prionace glauca)
   caught by the Brazilian tuna longline fleet between 1997 and 2008 (43
   546 longline sets) to predict the effect of environmental, spatial, and
   temporal factors on catch distribution. In addition, the size
   distribution of blue sharks measured by on-board observers during the
   years 2006-2008 was used to model the proportion of juvenile blue sharks
   in the catches from a spatial perspective. Latitude was the most
   important factor influencing blue shark cpue in the Southwest Atlantic,
   with cpue spatial predictions suggesting two areas of higher catch
   probabilities. Latitude was also the most important factor influencing
   the proportion of juveniles in the catches. The spatial prediction map
   showed that juveniles were more frequently caught south of 35 degrees S
   (similar to 38 degrees S). This information can assist in the design of
   management strategies either to exploit this predictable spatial
   distribution of the catch or to manage the fisheries in a spatially
   explicit manner if one component (i.e. juveniles) requires protective
   measures.},

Title = {Taxonomic relatedness and spatial structure of a shelf benthic gastropod
   assemblage},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-34},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Aim
   Phylogenetically related species share attributes that lead to common
   responses to environmental conditions, but which could also produce the
   exclusion of species by its relatives. These processes could generate
   the patterns of phylogenetic attraction or repulsion in local
   communities, where related species would tend to coexist more or less
   than expected by chance. This paper aims to (1) analyse the phylogenetic
   structure of a benthic gastropod assemblage in the south-western
   Atlantic Ocean (SAO); (2) explore the linkages between phylogenetic
   structure and spatial distribution patterns; (3) compare outcomes driven
   by the analysis of presence-only data and predictive species
   distribution models; and (4) explore which aspects of the gained
   knowledge can be useful to the design of sound conservation and/or
   management actions.
   Location
   Uruguayan shelf and slope in the SAO.
   Methods
   Spatial patterns in taxonomical relatedness were assessed using (1) raw
   presence/absence data (i.e. realized niche approach) and (2)
   reconstruction of the potential composition of the assemblage from niche
   modelling (i.e. fundamental niche approach). Null models were used to
   test hypotheses on assemblage structure.
   Results
   Significant departures from the null hypothesis that all species were
   drawn from the same assemblage were observed irrespectively of the
   approach, indicating the existence of non-random structures. However, a
   high proportion of local communities can be thought as random subsets of
   the regional species pool. This lack of a strong signal of a taxonomic
   effect could be related to the absence of a linkage between taxonomic
   distances and ecological similarities.
   Main conclusions
   Our results suggest a random assembly of local communities from the
   regional species pool and/or niche filtering independent of phylogeny as
   main determinants of local community composition. We also suggest that
   local assemblages displaying significantly higher (or lower) than
   expected taxonomic relatedness should be taken into consideration for
   designing spatially explicit conservation measures.},

   International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas database
   for 1998 to 2007. Four main environmental variables were considered: sea
   surface temperature (SST), mixed layer depth, chlorophyll concentration,
   and bathymetry. Results indicated that adults were more frequent to the
   cast of 25 degrees W in areas with a shallow mixed layer (<30 m),
   between 3000 and 6000 m depth, and SSTs lower than 24 degrees C. The
   proportion of adults was highest at chlorophyll concentrations between

Abstract = {Generalized Regression Analysis and Spatial Prediction (GRASP) was used
   to map the spatial distribution of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the
   South Atlantic. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to relate
   catch to environmental predictor variables. Catch information from
   38,000 Brazilian pelagic longline sets from 1980 to 2000 and size
   frequency data from 5000 longline sets from 1982 to 2000 were obtained
   from International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna
   (ICCAT). Results highlight the importance of environmental variables for
   the fishery and for the spatial distribution of different size classes
   of swordfish (small, intermediate and large). The distribution of
   swordfish was closely associated with convergence zones (inter-tropical
   and sub-tropical), especially in the months of greatest convergence
   intensity. Spatial distribution patterns differed for the three studied
   size classes. The smallest size classes were found mainly in coastal
   zones and in areas with a shallow mixed layer (<20 m). In contrast
   intermediate-sized swordfish were mostly associated with the
   inter-tropical convergence and mixed layers of more than 20 m depth and
   large swordfish were often found in the vicinity of the sub-tropical
   convergence zone and in areas with mixed layers of less than 25 m and
   greater than 60 m. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
