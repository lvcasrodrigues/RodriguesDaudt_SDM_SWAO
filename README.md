# Species distribution modelling in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean

In this repository, you will find all the data and code from [Rodrigues, Daudt et al. (202X)](https://github.com/lvcasrodrigues/RodriguesDaudt_SDM_SWAO#citation), and the supporting results referenced in the main text.

In this study, we carried out a literature search and bibliographic analyses to identify trends and gaps in published articles applying Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWAO), up to 2022. 

***
In ``, you will find the data needed to reproduce the analysis (for details, please check the manuscript).

* In `RodriguesDaudt_etal_SDM_SWAO_Supplementary_Material_1.rar` you will find the following files:
  * savedrecs_09_05_23.bib = raw data retrieved from Web of Science;
  * scopus_09_05_23.bib = raw data retrieved from Scopus;
  * RodriguesDaudt_etal_SDM_SWAO_**Table_S1** = list of the screened articles (n = 120) retrieved from WoS and Scopus databases using the chosen search terms after removing duplicates (see Methods, in the main text), classified by id number, source, authors, title, journal, language, publisher and year of publication;
  * RodriguesDaudt_etal_SDM_SWAO_**Table_S2** = list of the retained articles (n = 62), subject of our analyses, retrieved from WoS and Scopus databases after filtering according to our criteria (see Methods, in the main text), classified by id number, source, authors, title, journal, language, publisher and year of publication, taxonomic group, focus of research, adjacent country, analytical method, number of methods, type of biological data, number of environmental layers and type of environmental data;
  * RodriguesDaudt_etal_SDM_SWAO_**Table_S3** = detailed categories used to classify each retained article (n = 62) on the research focus and the large taxonomic groups;
