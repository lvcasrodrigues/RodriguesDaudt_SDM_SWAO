abstract={Soft corals (Anthozoa: Octocorallia) are discreet components in the Southwestern Atlantic reef communities. In Brazil, the native octocoral shallow-reef fauna is mostly represented by gorgonians. Consequently, except for the nephtheid Neospongodes atlantica, most of the known soft corals from this region are considered non-indigenous. Hitherto, the monotypic genus Neospongodes, which was proposed in the early 1900s, has been considered to be endemic to the Northeastern Brazilian coast. Herein, based on in situ records, we show that N. atlantica is a substrate generalist that has been probably expanding its distribution by dominating extensive shallow and mesophotic sandy and reef bottoms, generally outcompeting other reef benthic organisms, including Brazilian endemic species. Based on previously unidentified museum specimens, new records, and a broad literature review, we provide the most comprehensive modelling of the potential distribution of this species in the Southwestern Atlantic. Based on molecular inference supported by in-depth morphological analysis, the probable non-indigenous and, therefore, ancient introduction of N. atlantica in Brazilian waters is discussed. Finally, these results support that Neospongodes and the Indo-Pacific Stereonephthya are synonyms, which led us to propose the latter as taxonomically invalid. Copyright © 2022 Cordeiro et al.},

abstract={We performed morphological analyses on Ascidiella individuals collected on artificial substrates deployed at Puerto Madryn (Argentina) and individuals from collections. We test the validity of traditional characters, used previously to evaluate differences between two congeneric Ascidiella species. The study reveals A. scabra in a port area of the SW Atlantic for the first time, and represents the second record of the species outside its native range. The species could have arrived to South America as biofouling in ship hulls, having established itself in ports, but ignored for a time, confused with its congener A. aspersa, also non-indigenous species for the study area. Ecological Niche Model approaches display potential risk of introduction in high suitable areas worldwide, highlighting these located far away from the native distribution, such as the NW Atlantic and the SW Pacific. The spread along coastal areas of the SW Atlantic could also be expected. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Defining a species’ ecological niche is not a trivial task particularly for marine taxa, since physical and biological constraints are not easily perceived in these environments. Yet, coastal habitats are divided into provinces, influenced by different environmental conditions, such as superficial marine currents, causing seasonality in marine productivity and biomass. The South American Tern Sterna hirundinacea is a poorly known, migratory seabird distributed along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of South America, including the Malvinas/Falkland Islands, and occurring in most of the South American coastal provinces. Limited knowledge on the migratory behaviour of the species points to differential habits between southern and northern populations. The species’ breeding season also varies with latitude and season, occurring during spring in the south and in the fall in northern areas of the species occurrence. These observations point to putatively ecologically distinct populations along the species range that seem to be coincident with coastal provinces. To test our hypotheses, we estimated full-range ecological niche models per season, and we used coastal provinces to model ecological niches for each of the known breeding areas/seasons. We also tested for environmental space differentiation between seasons and breeding and non-breeding areas. Overall, the species does not seem to occupy significantly different ecological niches throughout the year, except during the breeding season, particularly between the Warm Temperate Southeastern Pacific and Warm Temperate Southwestern Atlantic provinces in fall. This suggests that the South American Tern migratory behaviour, the selection of different microhabitats and reproductive areas or distinct biological interactors might be influencing the species environmental space. Nonetheless, our models reinforce the gradual migration of this tern species towards the south, spending the summer mostly in the Malvinas/Falkland Islands. Interestingly, the species seems to be resident in Peru coastal area. Thus, despite the absence of ecological divergence, population structure should be tested and demographic trends assessed along the species range. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Adelomelon beckii (Broderip,1836) is the largest Volutidae from the Western Atlantic, and one of the largest marine gastropods worldwide. We analysed data from 516 trawls performed in the Uruguayan continental shelf between 5 and 300 m depth and developed a predictive species distribution model, identifying shelf areas in which fleet activity should be monitored in relation to landings of A. becki. According to our model, the fleets potentially affecting the Uruguayan population of A. beckii include the coastal industrial fleet and, to a lesser extent, the fleet targeting Argentinean Hake in the outer shelf. In order to minimize the likelihood of further reduction of the population of A. beckii within Uruguayan waters, management measures should include the implementation of specific fishery regulations for the commercial fleet and ships' crews, including a) closed areas, that ensure the reproductive success of the population and/ or b) prohibition of shell trade in stores along the coast, aiming to definitively stop landings of A. beckii. An appropriate understanding of the ecological and spatial structure, resilience and dynamics of the species is critical to this end.},
